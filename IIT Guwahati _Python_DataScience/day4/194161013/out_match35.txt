Thanks Alex. Well, though it's rather too late to make a real difference, South Africa appear to have hit their straps. They're in sight of a pride-salvaging win.

Nilashish: "Still remember being a 9 year old kid in 1996, watching my first world cup on TV, a small black and white Bush, mesmerized by the slaughter of UAE by Kirsten, but more so by Andrew Hudson against Netherlands. Was so impressed by Hudson, I coaxed my uncle to take me to the test match at Eden later that year, again, Hudson didn't disappoint me, but I saw my Hero's debut there, a guy called Lance klusener..

Amla is walking off already. Ball tracking says it pitched outside leg! That was always the query. It will be reversed. Amla has to walk back. Faf was correct. It pitched just outside leg. Only fractionally. It did look in doubt live but Amla thought it was out.

Dilshan and Herath followed, Malinga soon too. SLC needs to learn from the last four years, pick a group of 18-20 players, and regardless of the results, critics and backlash, stick with those players for an extended period of time. Same goes for the captaincy and coaching staff"

Duminy to de Silva, OUT, Bowled him! Oh no! A premeditated reverse sweep and he misses it! Duminy coming around the wicket. It was tossed up on leg, he set up so early, hadn't even had a look at one delivery, tried to reverse sweep it behind point and missed it completely. It crashed into middle and leg.

Morris to Mathews, 1 wide, pushed too far down the leg side, and that's one for the extras column
Gaja: "Wondering about people, who says Thirimanne is a failure? He was never given consistent chances. Opened the batting in 1 match, then moved to #3, then dropped because 4 5 & 6 didn't score. Look at Jeewan Mendis? What he has done to be in the team?" -- A bit of everything, hasn't he?

Morris to Mathews, no run, just short of Amla at slip! Morris immediately hits a probing length, headed for the top of off, and a flat-footed push brings a thick edge. But the ball dips and dies in front of Amla
Shahzeb: "why not imran tahir is brought into the attack?" -- It surely won't be long until he is, especially with these long straight boundaries. But not just yet - here's Chris Morris. Amla remains at slip

Rabada to BKG Mendis, 1 run, short and rising on middle and leg, but it's pulled with some control down to fine leg
Aniruddha: "Very lackluster efforts by South Africa. Waiting for batsmen to commit mistake. What to say more?" -- A little unfair, I think. It's not a blast-them-out kind of pitch, and the medium pacers have adapted well

Rabada to BKG Mendis, no run, a touch of seam movement for Rabada, back in off the track, and Mendis defends from the crease
Prashantha: "Avishka was a revelation after the constant failures and Thirimanne. We should stick with him for a while -- as even when he scores a 30, still we are in an ok position, while Thirimanne time and time again gifts the momentum to the opposition with negative batting. As for me, following the match all the way from Qatar and rooting for our boys to gain a semifinal berth!"

In the middle, meanwhile, Rabada's back

Pretorius to BKG Mendis, no run, uppish! But short of van der Dussen in the covers. Again, Pretorius has just got the ball to stop in the track, and Kusal pushed too early at it with hard hands
