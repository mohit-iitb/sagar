Right that wraps it up for this game. Join us tomorrow, because only this match has ended, the World Cup hasn't. Till then, this is Saurabh Somani signing off on behalf of Peter Della Penna and Chandan Duorah.

7.30pm: Captains speak time.

Gulbadin Naib: "They are a champion side, so you can't have any mistake against them. We didn't have a good start with our openers, so obviously we were a bit on the back foot. After that Rahmat and Nabi got stuck in the wicket, so the pressure was there. Looking at the England conditions, you can take this kind of step (bringing in Hamid). Hope there is something for spin in the upcoming matches."

Aaron Finch: "Always a bit of nerves, we've been training together so long now. We were probably ready to go four days ago, long build up. But good to get a first win. Wickets in the Powerplay are crucial to any side, if you look at the data, so pretty good to get a couple early. Couple of sharp run-out chances from Smithy. I felt good today, you get a couple away early and get a good flow going. Warner is very important to our side. He was struggling to time the ball in the first half, but the fact that he kept hanging in there was great for him. He did the job at the end. Important you don't look too far ahead."

7.24pm: David Warner is the Man of the Match. "Good to be back. Great win and good start for us. Gotta keep the ball rolling. Nerves getting back into the camp and getting back into the full intensity of training. I was a bit more relaxed when Finchy started going. For us it's getting past this first victory and move on to the West Indies. We know the bowlers always say that one-day cricket is a batsman's game, but you saw the out and out quicks going through the batsmen. For us as batters, its about holding our nerve. This team is a different one from the team back then (in 2015) but there is a great energy and great buzz about this team."

7.20pm: Command performance by Australia, particularly while batting. While bowling too, they had the better of Afghanistan except for a few overs at the end. But the good work done upfront meant they didn't have much to chase. The batsmen came out with purpose. Finch was aggressive, Warner was intent on batting through. Both did that. Would have been perfect if Smith had stayed unbeaten, but you can't deny the perfection of a finish that has a Maxwell boundary at the end. Australia's defence is up and running, and in some style too. Stick around for the presentations.

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Maxwell, FOUR runs, well my forecasting skills are not exact but Maxwell does finish it off with a boundary. Full ball outside off and slaughtered over extra cover, two bounces into the fence to clinch victory for Australia.
So it won't be a fairytale comeback of Smith and Warner sharing an unbeaten partnership to drive Australia to victory. Maybe Glenn Maxwell will hit a six to finish to compensate?

Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Smith, OUT, anti-climax wide outside off and it was there to be square driven, but bounced a bit more than he expected and he gets an upper edge that loops to short third man. Smith falls with just three runs to get for victory

Hamza: "4 one-sided matches in the world cup so far. What does your score predictor say for the remaining 44 matches and today's champions league final?" - says the magic formula for exciting cricket is to log on to ESPNcricinfo and get 10 other friends to log on. Who must each get 10 friends too. And so on...

Rahul Gupta: "This partnership is a statement! Beware, Aussies will dominate this world cup too. "

Dawlat Zadran to Warner, 2 runs, direct hit would've nailed Smith coming back for the second! Short of a length ball on the legs and clipped behind square, Rashid charges in from long leg to cut off a second run and fires for the non-striker's end where Smith is struggling badly. Dawlat stood mid-pitch never bothering to get back over the stumps while Zazai was slow moving to cover the stumps from mid-off as well. Double-lapse not covering the relay or else the bails could've been knocked off easily. Dawlat gestures at Zazai upset at him for not covering but he is as much to blame.
Dawlat replaces Hamid

Rashid Khan to Warner, 1 run, full outside off, Warner goes to reverse paddle and misses off the thigh. He was struck well outside the line of off stump as they scamper a leg bye but Gulbadin is talked into a very speculative review. Not just that but replays show Warner gloved it.

Smith takes guard having entered off strike at the end of the last over. Greeted by boos as he scratches his mark out.

"This summer, there will always be someone talking about Steve Smith. And while that happens there will be Smith batting in the middle, the nets, his mind and the shower." - that's Jarrod Kimber on the man who's back from the ban and walking in to join another man who's back from the ban.

Millat: "Why is Afghanistan holding back Hamid Hasan? When he will bowl again?After the end of the match?" I agree. Nabi's spell has been very tame. And speak of the devil, here comes back No. 66, the greatest in my eyes since Mario Lemieux. If you don't know who that is, google is your friend. Over the stumps to Warner.

Rashid Khan to Khawaja, OUT, gone with the googly! Khawaja looked like he wanted to go with another reverse to a good length ball pitching on middle, then changed his mind while the ball was in the air and awkwardly waved across the line. Plonked on the knee roll, big appeal upheld. Khawaja has a brief chat with Warner before deciding to walk off without using the review. Looked pretty straight. Replays confirm it would have been three reds on balltracking.
